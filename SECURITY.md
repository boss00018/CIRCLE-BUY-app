# Security Checklist

## âœ… Fixed Security Issues

### Critical Issues Fixed
- [x] **Hardcoded Credentials (CWE-798)**: Moved all API keys and sensitive data to environment variables
- [x] **NoSQL Injection (CWE-943)**: Added input validation and sanitization for all Firestore operations
- [x] **Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79/80)**: Implemented input sanitization for user-controllable data
- [x] **Path Traversal (CWE-22/23)**: Fixed unsafe file path handling in components

### High Priority Issues Fixed
- [x] **Inadequate Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- [x] **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352)**: Added CSRF protection headers and request validation
- [x] **Missing Input Validation**: Implemented validation for all user inputs

### Code Quality Issues Fixed
- [x] **Performance Issues**: Replaced inline functions with memoized components
- [x] **Type Safety**: Removed unsafe type casting and added proper TypeScript interfaces
- [x] **Code Maintainability**: Extracted inline styles to StyleSheet objects
- [x] **Naming Consistency**: Improved variable and function naming conventions

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In
- Role-based access control (super_admin, admin, buyer)
- JWT token validation on server endpoints
- Secure token storage using React Native encrypted storage

### Data Protection
- Input sanitization for all user inputs
- Parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Proper error handling without information leakage

### Network Security
- HTTPS enforcement (production)
- CSRF protection headers
- Request validation and rate limiting
- Secure API endpoint design

### Client-Side Security
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Secure storage for sensitive data
- Input validation on client side
- XSS prevention through sanitization

## Remaining Security Considerations

### For Production Deployment
- [ ] Enable Firebase App Check for additional security
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on server endpoints
- [ ] Set up proper Firebase security rules
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring
- [ ] Set up backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Regular security audits and dependency updates

### Firebase Security Rules Example
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Products can be read by authenticated users
    match /products/{productId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.sellerId;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.token.role == 'admin' || 
         request.auth.token.role == 'super_admin');
    }
    
    // Marketplaces can only be managed by super admins
    match /marketplaces/{marketplaceId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.token.role == 'super_admin';
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Monitoring

### Recommended Tools
- Firebase Security Rules testing
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (npm audit)
- Static code analysis tools
- Runtime application security monitoring

### Regular Security Tasks
- Update dependencies monthly
- Review Firebase security rules quarterly
- Audit user permissions regularly
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Backup critical data regularly
